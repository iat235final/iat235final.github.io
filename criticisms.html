                Aside all the benefits of drug decrminalization, it is important to look at some of its drawbacks in terms of
                how it practiced in Portugal itself and the implications such a radical policy may have in other countries.

                            was implemented. However, this may be accounted for by improvement in measurement practices, 
                            which includes a <b>doubling of toxicological autopsies</b> now being performed, meaning that more drugs

                            It has been proposed that this effect may have been related to the candor of interviewees, 
                            who may have been inclined to answer<b>more truthfully</b> due to a <b>reduction in the stigma</b> associated with
                             drug use. However, during the same period, the use of heroin and cannabis also increased in Spain and
                            Italy, where drugs for personal use was decriminalised many years earlier than in Portugal while the 
                            use of Cannabis and heroin decreased in the rest of Western Europe. The increase in drug use observed 
                            among adults in Portugal was not greater than that seen in nearby countries that did not change their 
                            laws.</h6></p>

                            The number and
                        composition of drug arrests and administrative citations in 2010 were <b>almost identical</b>
                        to the arrests for trafficking and use recorded in 2000, before the law entered into force. 
                        This net widening is thought to be the result of
                        the <b>relative ease with which police officers could issue notices</b> compared to the previous
                        system that required more extensive criminal booking procedures. As a consequence,
                        there was actually an increase in criminal prosecutions for marijuana due to outstanding
                        fines levied on those who received police notices.</h6></p>

            <h5>1. It may encourage experimentation.</h5>
            <p><h6 style="font-size:0.9em;font-weight:400;line-height:160%;">
            Some individuals may have a genetic disposition toward drug use and addiction. Allowing these people to have open access to whatever drug they wish to use could create an atmosphere where experimentation is encouraged. If there are no laws in place that would prevent them from acquiring whatever drugs they wish to have, it could create more health problems for certain individuals – even with greater access to treatment.
            </h6></p>
            </li>

            <li>
            <h5>2. It would reduce prices.</h5>
            <p><h6 style="font-size:0.9em;font-weight:400;line-height:160%;">
            When there isn’t a legal barrier in place to prevent drug access, the system of a free market takes over for the industry. That means there is a greater supply of the drug available, which could lower prices. If pricing is a barrier to entry or experimentation for some individuals, then the decriminalization of drugs would encourage them to try something when they may not have done so otherwise. Some drugs only require one dose to become addictive or potentially life-threatening.
            </h6></p>
        </li>

            <li>
            <h5>3. Treatment infrastructures are not present.</h5>
            <p><h6 style="font-size:0.9em;font-weight:400;line-height:160%;">
            Although the costs of incarceration and treatment would be reduced, the cost of treating addictions in the general population would rise. The current infrastructure may not be able to support the added number of individuals who would seek out help. That would mean added costs would come in the form of building assets and training more counselors to handle the needs of the society. Depending upon how decriminalization was implemented, the costs could be higher than they are under the current structure.
            </h6></p>
        </li>

            <li>
            <h5>4. Decriminalization can lead to legalization.</h5>
            <p><h6 style="font-size:0.9em;font-weight:400;line-height:160%;">
            Although the purpose may not be to legalize drugs with a decriminalization effort, there is always the potential that this could happen. For some drugs, such as marijuana, legalization can provide tax benefits to fund school and infrastructure programs, along with treatment opportunities. For strong drugs, such as heroin or meth, the benefits of decriminalizing its use could be less than the risks to society that these drugs cause. Strong drugs can cause behavioral changes that lead to violence.
            </h6></p>
        </li>

            <li>
            <h5>5. Safety problems could become worse instead of better.</h5>
            <p><h6 style="font-size:0.9em;font-weight:400;line-height:160%;">
            Even when safe centers are placed in areas of high drug use, individuals may still choose to take their drugs in non-safe locations. Increased access to injectable drugs could result in higher health risks for exposure in public locations. People who have taken drugs and then drive somewhere place the public at risk as well, just as if the person had been drinking alcohol and driving. Alcohol may be the primary contributor to violence, but increased access to drugs of any type will increase the risks of violence occurring to someone.
            <br><br>
            These decriminalization of drugs pros and cons suggest that the benefits seen in Portugal could be something that other nations may experience as well. Because drugs can be potentially harmful or be the cause of violent behavior, there must be strong controls placed upon the use of these substances. There must be logical consequences in the court system to protect the safety of the general population. At the end of the day, it is up to each community to decide if decriminalization is the right way to move forward.
